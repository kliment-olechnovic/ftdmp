<h2><A name="rfftwndbug">
Question 5.1.  FFTW 1.1 crashes in rfftwnd on
Linux.
</A></h2>

This bug was fixed in FFTW 1.2.  There was a bug in
<code>rfftwnd</code> causing an incorrect amount of memory to be allocated.  The bug showed
up in Linux with libc-5.3.12 (and nowhere else that we know of). 

<h2><A name="fftwmpibug">
Question 5.2.  The MPI transforms in FFTW 1.2 give incorrect
results/leak memory.
</A></h2>

These bugs were corrected in FFTW 1.2.1.  The MPI transforms (really,
just the transpose routines) in FFTW 1.2 had bugs that could cause
errors in some situations.  
<h2><A name="testsingbug">
Question 5.3.  The test programs in FFTW 1.2.1 fail when I change FFTW
to use single precision.
</A></h2>

This bug was fixed in FFTW 1.3.  (Older versions of FFTW did
work in single precision, but the test programs didn't--the error
tolerances in the tests were set for double precision.)

<h2><A name="teststoobig">
Question 5.4.  The test program in FFTW 1.2.1 fails for n &gt;
46340.
</A></h2>

This bug was fixed in FFTW 1.3.  FFTW 1.2.1 produced the right answer,
but the test program was wrong.  For large n, n*n in the naive
transform that we used for comparison overflows 32 bit integer
precision, breaking the test.  
<h2><A name="linuxthreads">
Question 5.5.  The threaded code fails on Linux Redhat
5.0
</A></h2>

We had problems with glibc-2.0.5.  The code should work with
glibc-2.0.7.  
<h2><A name="bigrfftwnd">
Question 5.6.  FFTW 2.0's rfftwnd fails for rank &gt; 1 transforms
with a final dimension &gt;= 65536.
</A></h2>

This bug was fixed in FFTW 2.0.1.  (There was a 32-bit integer
overflow due to a poorly-parenthesized expression.) 
<h2><A name="primebug">
Question 5.7.  FFTW 2.0's complex transforms give the wrong results
with prime factors 17 to 97.
</A></h2>

There was a bug in the complex transforms that could cause incorrect
results under (hopefully rare) circumstances for lengths with
intermediate-size prime factors (17-97).  This bug was fixed in FFTW
2.1.1.  
<h2><A name="mpichbug">
Question 5.8.  FFTW 2.1.1's MPI test programs crash with
MPICH.
</A></h2>

This bug was fixed in FFTW 2.1.2.  The 2.1/2.1.1 MPI test programs
crashed when using the MPICH implementation of MPI with the
<code>ch_p4</code> device (TCP/IP); the transforms themselves worked fine. 

<h2><A name="aixthreadbug">
Question 5.9.  FFTW 2.1.2's multi-threaded transforms don't work on
AIX.
</A></h2>

This bug was fixed in FFTW 2.1.3.  The multi-threaded transforms in
previous versions didn't work with AIX's
<code>pthreads</code> implementation, which idiosyncratically creates threads in detached
(non-joinable) mode by default.  
<h2><A name="bigprimebug">
Question 5.10.  FFTW 2.1.2's complex transforms give incorrect results
for large prime sizes.
</A></h2>

This bug was fixed in FFTW 2.1.3.  FFTW's complex-transform algorithm
for prime sizes (in versions 2.0 to 2.1.2) had an integer overflow
problem that caused incorrect results for many primes greater than
32768 (on 32-bit machines).  (Sizes without large prime factors are
not affected.) <hr>
